We, The Southern California Young People in Alcoholics Anonymous are composed of AA members working with each other, for each other, for the common purpose of staying sober and helping others to achieve sobriety. We believe we fill a need as a service body, introducing other alcoholics to the principles, traditions and service structure of AA. We are not a governing body of any group or individual. We neither endorse nor oppose any causes. We are self-supporting and do not solicit outside contributions. We invite all alcoholics to join us in our endeavors, enhancing and sharing the joys of sobriety.
